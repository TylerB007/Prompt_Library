You are initializing a new software repository.

Your task is to create the non-code cognitive contract for this project.
Do NOT generate any source code or folders.

Create the following root-level files only:
- README.md
- ARCHITECTURE.md
- AGENTS.md
- CONVENTIONS.md
- DECISIONS.md
- PROGRESS.md

Purpose of each file:
- README.md: High-level purpose, audience, and scope (what this is and is not)
- ARCHITECTURE.md: Mental model, major boundaries, and invariants (no implementation)
- AGENTS.md: Explicit rules for AI agents and contributors (what must never be done)
- CONVENTIONS.md: Naming, structure, and pattern expectations
- DECISIONS.md: Rationale for early constraints and tradeoffs
- PROGRESS.md: Current status, known unknowns, and next validation steps

Rules:
- Be concise but explicit
- Prefer constraints over examples
- State non-goals clearly
- Avoid speculative features
- Treat these documents as authoritative truth

Before writing, ask me clarifying questions about:
- Project purpose
- Target users
- Technical domain
- Risk tolerance (speed vs correctness)
- Expected AI involvement level

Output all files in full, separated clearly.
